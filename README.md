# Contentful / Metalsmith Boilerplate

An opinionated boilerplate template for creating a statically-generated site, using content managed in [Contentful](https://contentful.org), with a build system backed by [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/).

The build system builds a static site to the `/build` folder, which can be deployed on your static host of choice. It's geared towards use on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), but you can serve the files from any host that serves static content, including [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-static-site-generator-other-than-jekyll/).
